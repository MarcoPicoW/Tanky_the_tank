# Tanky_the_tank
I'm trying to build a little tank using a Rapberry Pico (W) and some 3D printed pieces.

I'll use two steppers (from a 3D printer), two stepper driver A4988, a Raspberry Pico W,
a rotary encoder, some leds (with resistence) and 12V USB-C powwerboost.

for the 3D printed part I'm still trying to find the right Form, I'll upload my leatest plans.

In the future it will maybe have a BT function controlled via app. But for the moment I don't know how to do it.
